# CIS 1051 FinalProject Proposal
My silly little final project proposal:

I must create something cool, fabulous, stylish for my final project, to prove I learned code. 
Do I go something super simple like a word game, no UI just words? NO!
Do I go something a little more complex? YES! And by a little I mean a 2.5D game that has potential to be a real game.
We want to blow the project out the water!

So here is the idea, I want both magic but physical combat. So something like a wizard but something like a smaruai?

Samurai Wizard is a 2.5D game! What is 2.5D? Simply a 2D game with 3D graphics. (This allows me to use assets I bought since I can not model. I can focus only on code)

In this game you move left or right killing monsters spawning from portals. This is a wave base game. Kiling monsters give exp, enough of that exp you can level up and select between 3 skill options. Physical/Magical/Stat. The 3 Catigories are randomized and you are given 3 rerolls Max. 

Your goal is to complete the level as quick as possible and become as as strong as possible. 

This is a basic game, with only 1 level, 3 bosses, 3 enemy types. Maybe around 9 skills. Nothing insane, but allows a little replayablitiy. 

This game could have potential to be a full fledge game, but we will do a prototype for the final project. Maybe if the video I make for this does good, it becomes a playable game on steam. 

Now are we doing this project alone? Yes, we are lonely. 
BUT I am helping others with their own projects who need it, from simple recreations of flappy bird to even more simpler recreations of flappy bird. The range is pretty far. 

I simply don't know how to work in a team or how to incorporate others in my own project. 

Any questions to myself? I asked a few through this which sounds kinda strange but no questions except to future me! 
The question is....

How is the video doing? Are we famous yet? Did the game become a big game? Am I a Samurai Wizard?
